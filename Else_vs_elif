#Complete the code in the editor to label each app as "free," "affordable," "expensive," or "very expensive." Inside the loop, do the following:

#If the price of the app is 0, label the app as "free" by appending the string 'free' to the current iteration variable.

#If the price of the app is greater than 0 and less than 20, label the app as "affordable". For efficiency purposes, use an elif clause.

#If the price of the app is greater or equal to 20 and less than 50, label the app as "expensive". For efficiency purposes, use an elif clause.

#If the price of the app is greater or equal to 50, label the app as "very expensive". For efficiency purposes, use an elif clause.

#Name the newly created column "price_label" by appending the string 'price_label' to the first row of the apps_data data set.

#Inspect the header row and the first five rows to see some of the changes you made.
